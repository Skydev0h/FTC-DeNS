# FreeTON Contest - Decentralized Name Service
This is an implementation of DeNS elements according to the [contest specification](https://devex.gov.freeton.org/proposal?proposalAddress=0:6f72de4f9e5e04c949d048716e43cc9b6b33f1236dc7ffd3245c676925ce2a07) that is based upon [TIP-2 proposal](https://forum.freeton.org/t/tip-2-decentralized-certificates-decert/7800).

## Important points

> Root contract is deployed in **DevNet** at address:

First of all, I would like to provide several things, that differentiate this contract the most.

I will abbreviate `DensClass` as `D-Class` to make it a little shorter *and cooler*.

* The most interesting thing in this implementation is existence of thin `D-Platform` middleware smart contract. It has bare minimum amount of code and has some necessary static parameters to build the tree structure (`root`, `type_id`, `name`, `parent`). The code of required contract is instantly installed over this platform right after deployment.
* The smart contracts (`D-Certificate`, `D-Auction`) cannot be deployed directly and are installed exclusively by upgrading the `D-Platform` smart contract (`type_id` = `1` for `D-Certificate` and `2` for `D-Auction`)
* Therefore, it is possible to update the `D-Certificate` code (image for new deployments and updating existing certificates) and `D-Auction` (image for new deployments) code and with that do not update the `D-Platform` code - because of this all addresses will not change and still can be deployed and resolved to the same old addresses - no need for code version history
* The code (images) is kept only in the `D-Root`, subcertificate deployment is carried out by calling a special function in the `D-Root` by the `D-Certificate`, which is instigated by calling a special command in the certificate by it's owner. Also, certificate can ask root to update itself (send new version of code). This way it is not necessary to store image in each certificate, and still, certificate can deploy new subcertificates by asking root to do that.
* Contracts do not accept payments directly (to prevent errorneous transfers), it is possible to explicitly call `addBalance` function with an internal message to add funds to the smart contract balance
* Transfer of ownership is secure (with confirmation to prevent errors), root is owned by pubkey, while certificates are owned by a smart contract (address), it is done this way because of some specifics of calling of methods and deployment
* It is possible to reserve address and specify reserve expiry date, reserve and unreserve are done by owner of root, I couldn't find a pluggable SMV implementation for voting system.

## Summary

The implementation consists of several smart contracts that are responsible for specific area in the system.

### DensRoot

The root smart contract is responsible for keeping and installing code of other components. Also it is the communication nexus that coordinates all other parts - users, debots, certificates and auctions.

### DensPlatform

The platform is the basement for other contracts such as certificates and auctions. Platform has a very small and simple code and is used to deploy contracts at specific places that can be easily precalculated with known data even locally.

### DensCertificate

The certificate is the node and leaf of the DeNS tree. It holds information about pointing to a specific smart contract address that can be retrieved and updated by the certificate owner. Also the certificate can ask root to deploy subcertificates (subdomains) on behalf of the owner.

### DensAuction

The vickrey auction system is used to distribute domains under the root smart contract. It is deployed and destroyed on-demand when needed, holds funds of auction participants and returns them back when auction is complete.

### DensDebot

The debot is used for user interaction with the system elements. Currently it is under development.

## Compiling, deploying and running

There are several ways to compile, deploy and run the contracts.

You may not even need to deploy them at all and just use artifacts in the `build` directory.

#### Compiling

In order to just rebuild code from solidity you may use `sol.sh` file. However, it is mostly intended for development. Furthermore, `build.sh` recompiles solidity files and links them to `tvc` files ready for deployment.

#### Deploying

The most convenient way to deploy the root contract is to use `deploy_root.sh` script. It will verify existence of required tools for you and give hints where to get them if they do not exist and do everything required for successful deploy:

* Recompile solidity files (if solc is present)
* Relink deployment tvc files (if tvm_linker is present)
* Ensure existence of root keys and store them and their phrase in files
* Verify state of the contract and give hints what needs to be done
* Deploy the contract to the blockchain
* Verify state of template contract codes (platform, certificate, auction) and update them to the current version

Having done all those actions, the script will provide you with a configured DeNS Root SC in the blockchain.

> N.B. Pay attention to the currently selected network, it depends on your local tonos-cli configuration file.

---

As for the DeBot, you can deploy it using `deploy_debot.sh` script. It also takes care of account state, ABI configuration state and performs the required actions. Having deployed the debot script will run it to test whether it is working or not. 

#### Running

You can always run the debot using `run_debot.sh` script or just by calling `tonos-cli debot fetch <address>` directly.

---

## Interaction

As of now in order to control and interact with the system you need to use `tonos-cli` tool in shell. I have attempted to write a Debot, but due to some bug it fails the way it shouldn't fail (calling `resolveRPC` directly with same parameters on root works, while debot call crashes for some reason).

Deployment of root and configuration of platform, certificate and auction codes is done automatically by `deploy_root.sh` script. Likewise, you can deploy debot with `deploy_debot.sh` and start it later using `run_debot.sh` scripts. Initially, it was planned that contracts would be interacted using debots, however, it turned out that they crash for some reason.

Please use `interact.sh` to interact with the system. It has debot-like menu system but is implemented using scripts. 

### Using automatic box to send messages

In order to conveniently automatically send messages from a safe multisig contract for contract deployment and during interaction you need to generate `keys.json` in the `box` folder, then correctly deploy the SafeMultisigWallet contract in the `box` and provide it adequate funds for all the manipulations.

Otherwise you will need to supply Tons for deployment manually, and provide the generated encoded message body to the transaction sending routine of wallet of your choice.
